# Overview

This code provides abstractions (mostly housed [here](https://github.com/withtwoemms/recruitment/blob/main/recruitment/agency/__init__.py) at time of writing this) that support unified and robust interaction with cloud services.
The `Broker` concept allows for the recasting of methods provided by cloud integration SDKs (e.g. [boto](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/)) into an interface of your choosing. The `Communicator` SDK houses method bindings defined by the `Broker.interface` while the `Consumer`, `Publisher`, and `Agent` entities implement the bound interface with [actionpack](https://github.com/withtwoemms/actionpack)ed resilience ðŸ’¥

The picture, above, demonstrates a fail-safe apparatus where a `Publisher` publishes messages to some cloud backend and record failures to local disk when encountered. The `Agent` lives in a separate execution context and can re-publish failed messages.
